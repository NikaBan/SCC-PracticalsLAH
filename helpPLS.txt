So I'm fairly annoyed, it's pulsing. I don't like this. Also emotions are kind of 
all over the place. I need some balance. Shit is not going straight. I NEED ME SOME
DUMBO CUDDLES OMFG!

Also, did I mention I'm monologing in a notepad. I have sunk low. What am I doing 
with my life? Not living it, that's for sure. Is there an option to hit pause? Can 
someone put me in a coma like right now?
